# Proprioception-Code--Unity3D

This Code uses an environment created in Unity-3D to measure Proprioceptive Bias in Teleoperation tasks. Phantom Premium 3 is used as a master device and environment is rendered using Occulus to account for lack of hand eye coordination. https://zainmehdiblog.wordpress.com/proprioceptive-error-in-teleoperation/

This code uses Haptics Plugin for Unity3D https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-5-haptic-plugin-for-geomagic-openhaptics-3-3-hlapi-hdapi-34393
